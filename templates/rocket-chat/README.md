# RocketChat

![](catalogIcon-rocket.chat.svg)

A simple rocket chat stack which is inspired by the [Rocket.Chat docker-compose
file](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml).

The hubot container will not work out of the box, but instead requires a bot
user and password, [the Rocket.Chat docs
contain](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/docker-containers/docker-compose)
more details, therefore it is not included in this docker-compose file.
If you want to use it, you can simply add it manually within the stack.
